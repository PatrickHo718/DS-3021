# Patrick's Case Study 1

## What problems are facings the organization?

Much of the education industry makes wasteful investments, where billions of dollars are wasted. Funds are not being properly used to foster student success in the US education system.

## What is the target variable and what type (reg or class) of solution are they developing?

The target variable is the specific software implementation the school should invest in. It would be a classification solution as the type of software is a categorical variable. 

## How would they know the solution was working (business metric)?

The success of the model is determined by the outcomes on student performances, teacher satisfaction, and cost savings. To pitch an idea like this, showcasing the accuracy is not enough as stakeholders need to know how impactful and effective the model is. 

## what other issues might the team be facing? 

Other issues include the problem of find an equitable solution among districts and the size of the data. The different backgrounds and diversity of each district can cause noises to occur that the model needs to mitigate. Some districts may lack more resources than others or be under-represented in the data, in which would lead to some bias in the model. 

## How difficult is the data to gather?

It should be considerably difficult to gather data since it is through a survey. The quality of the data might be questionable as it is based on the willingness of school districts to provide their feedback and also there may be bias that can occur as it could be heavily based on opinion/  

## Is the target difficult to measure or break into smaller parts?

Target is difficult because it would be challenging to quantify student and teacher satisfaction. Since this target is more categorical, measuring it in number would be difficult. Breaking it into smaller parts require more feature engineering, which poses another challenge for the project. 

## What level of uncertainty (risk) are you willing to accept? 

I am willing to accept a medium level of uncertainty taking all the bias and noises of survey data into account. The risks of these survey data are inevitable as the project's foundation is established on the data from the school surveys.
